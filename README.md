# jvm.c

Learn C programming language by implementing a workable java virtual machine. Inspired by [jvm.go](https://github.com/zxh0/jvm.go). This project is under heavy development, and changes may mostly be committed at weekend. (I hope I can have more time on it.) This jvm curently is far from workable. 

Issues or programming skills are welcome.
